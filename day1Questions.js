  //What is an object? 
  // --- An object is a data structure, variable, function, or a collection of properties that refer to an instance of a class. 

  //When can you only use dot notation and not bracket notation?
  // --- Dot notation can be used exclusively for string key values, while bracket notation can be used for all other primitives. 

  //What is the difference between dot and bracket notation?
  // --- Dot notation can only take strings.??? Look at the slide The Rules

  //When can you only use brackets and not dot?
  // --- You can only use only bracket notation when there is a non-string data type as the key.

  //How do you add a property with a key that contains special characters?
  // --- Using brackets. box["^&*"] = "testing 123"

  //How do you add a property with a key that is stored in a variable?
	// --- 
  // var box = {}
  //var key = "Hello"
  //box[key] = "world
  
  //How do you add a property whose key and value are stored in different variables?
	// ---
  // var box = {}
  //var key = "Hello"
  //var sec = "world"
  //box[key] = sec
  
  //How do you access an object that is inside another object?
  // ---
  
  
  //How do we loop through objects to access the values?
	// --- for (var key in box){
  					console.log(key); // console.log(box[key]);
  				}
  
  //How do you create an object that is nested inside another object?
	// ---
